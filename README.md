# gservice

Lightweight service framework on top of gevent, implementing the "service model" -- services all the way down. 

## Contributing

Feel free to poke around the issues in the main repository and see if you can tackle any. From there you should:

    * Fork if you haven't
    * Create a branch for the feature / issue
    * Write code+tests
    * Pass tests (using nose)
    * Squash branch commits using [merge and reset](http://j.mp/vHLUoa)
    * Send pull request

We highly recommend using branches for all features / issues and then squashing it into a single commit in your master before issuing a pull request. It's actually quite easy using [merge and reset](http://j.mp/vHLUoa).

We're aiming for at least 90% test coverage. If you have the `coverage` Python package installed, you can run `python setup.py coverage` to get a coverage report of modules within gservice.
