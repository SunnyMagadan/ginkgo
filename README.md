# gservice

Lightweight service framework, implementing the "service model" -- services all the way down. 

## Contributing

Fork, write code+tests, pass tests, send pull request.

We highly recommend using branches for all features / issues and then squashing it into a single commit in your master before issuing a pull request. It's actually quite easy [using merge/reset](http://j.mp/vHLUoa).
