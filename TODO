- Real log support
- Manage/close/keep open file descriptors?
- Check API compatibility, make upgrade doc
- make sure exit codes are correct
- hook system?

To think about / design:
 - Generalized timeouts. Part of AsyncManager interface?
 - AsyncManager "backends". gevent, eventlet, threads, subprocesses
 - Multiprocess support. Pistil? 
 - Shared port bindings. Based on Pistil, expose with a Setting subclass Binding?
   - Also, binding ahead of time before shedding privs **
 - How can chroots be done as an extension. Middleware? Hooks? **

** Actually more important than the others for release
