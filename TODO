- make sure exit codes are correct

To think about / design:
 - Generalized timeouts. Part of AsyncManager interface?
 - AsyncManager "backends". gevent, eventlet, threads, subprocesses
 - Multiprocess support. Pistil? 
 - Shared port bindings. Based on Pistil, expose with a Setting subclass Binding?
